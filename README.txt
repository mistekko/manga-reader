# manga-reader

<p>This project is a simple python manga-reader that uses the "viewnior" image viewer (support for others will come in later versions. I hope). I'm sure it's not for everyone, but I find it really useful. It's primarily a personal project, so I WILL NOT maintain it regularly, but I do expect to update it occasionally. If you've got a feature request or suggestion for my code (I am very amateur, I expect it to be mediocre), open an issue and I'll be more than happy to adress it.</P>

### Installation:

<p>Pretty much no installation is necessary for this program. Just put it in a convenient directory and run it. I personally like to put it in my /bin so that it can be invoked as a command from whatever directory I want, but that my not go for everyone. Wow I sure don't sound professional at all, do I?</p>


### How to use:

manga-reader takes two arguments:
1. the directory containing the manga
2. the chapter at which you would like to start

<p>it will look for chapters based off of a four-digit naming scheme (i.e., 0001, 0231, 0019, etc.), which has some flaws, but I've yet to change it. This is the default of mangal, the best manga downloading application for linux, in my opinion.<</p>
