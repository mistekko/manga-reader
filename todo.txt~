to do:
    -Create help output <-- correction: IMPROVE help output
    -Generalise image viewer:
        >detect default image/jpg and image/png viewer
	?make the image viewer command into a string type variable
	      ?check /bin, /usr/bin, and working directory for different compatible image viewers (image-viewer, viewnior, gwenview, gnome default, kdefault, xfce default, and so on. Cinnamon, mate, uhh some more as well)
    -Save progress
    -Directory-choosing interface? Maybe?
    -figure out how to more elagantly select chapter folder
